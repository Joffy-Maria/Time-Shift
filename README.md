## Project Description  
TimeShift is an *alternate history time travel simulator* where you can change past events and watch the hilarious, shocking, and utterly absurd consequences unfold in the future ‚Äî all visualized through *AI-generated cinematic videos*.  

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Humanity has always struggled with boring reality. We live in a world where history has already been decided, and we have *no official government-approved tool* for turning Napoleon into a TikTok star or letting dinosaurs run for president.  

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We built a *time travel simulator* that lets you rewrite history, break the space-time continuum, and then laugh (or cry) at the butterfly effects ‚Äî powered by *Google Veo cinematic AI* so you can actually watch how ridiculous your decisions are.
